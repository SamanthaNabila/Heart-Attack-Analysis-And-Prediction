End-to-end data science project that analyzes clinical data and builds machine-learning models to predict the likelihood of a heart attack. Includes EDA, data preprocessing, model training/tuning, and evaluation.
The goal is to explore risk factors for heart disease and train classification models that can predict the target label (presence of heart disease).
The workflow covers:

Exploratory Data Analysis (univariate & bivariate visualizations, correlation heatmaps)

Data preparation (missing values check, outlier treatment, one-hot encoding, RobustScaler)

Model training & tuning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest with GridSearchCV)

Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC curve, AUC, cross-validation)
